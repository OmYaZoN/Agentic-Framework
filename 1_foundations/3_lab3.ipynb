       "\"Hello! Yes, I have completed several courses to expand my knowledge and skills. Here are a few notable ones:\\n\\n1. **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R** - This comprehensive course covered a wide range of machine learning topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and deep learning. I also received the ChatGPT Prize for this course.\\n\\n2. **Deep Learning A-Z 2025: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT** - This course delved deeper into deep learning, covering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers. I also received the ChatGPT Prize for this course.\\n\\n3. **Complete Agentic AI Bootcamp With LangGraph and Langchain** - This bootcamp focused on Agentic AI, a cutting-edge approach to AI that enables agents to perform complex tasks. I learned about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the Model Context Protocol, and various AI frameworks and SDKs.\\n\\n4. **Web Application Development** - This course covered full-stack web development, including front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js) and back-end (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) technologies.\\n\\n5. **Computer Networks and Security (CNS)** - This course provided a solid foundation in computer networks, protocols, and security measures.\\n\\n6. **Cyber Security** - This course focused on various aspects of cybersecurity, including network security, cryptography, and ethical hacking.\\n\\n7. **Data Science and Big Data Analytics (DSBDA)** - This course covered data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and big data processing using tools like Python, SQL, and Hadoop.\\n\\nI'm always eager to learn new things, so I'm constantly looking for new courses and projects to challenge myself.\""
