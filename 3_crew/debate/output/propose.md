**In favor of the motion**  
When a society is sharply divided into majority and minority communities, the democratic engine—policymaking, civic engagement, and social cohesion—comes to a grinding halt. The Indian context offers stark evidence:  

1. **Polarised political mobilisation** – Parties increasingly rely on caste, religion, and linguistic identities to mobilise votes. This turns policy debates into identity contests, marginalising issues that transcend group lines, such as economic development, health, and education.  

2. **Legitimacy crisis** – Majority dominance in public institutions breeds resentment among minorities, eroding trust in democratic institutions. When minorities feel systematically excluded, they are less likely to participate, weakening the representativeness of democracy.  

3. **Policy paralysis** – Attempts to guarantee identical equality—through uniform quotas, reservations, or equal access mandates—often backfire. They can be perceived as forced equalisation, provoking backlash from the majority who view it as reverse discrimination. This intensifies social conflict and can lead to protests, riots, or even demands for segregationist policies.  

4. **Erosion of pluralism** – Democracy thrives on the constructive coexistence of diverse voices. When equality becomes a zero‑sum game, the focus shifts from collaborative problem‑solving to protecting group privileges, stalling progress on national issues such as infrastructure, technology, and climate action.  

Thus, the fragmentation of society into majority/minority blocks not only hampers democratic functioning but also fuels conflict when equality is demanded as a uniform equalizer. The result is a stagnant democracy, trapped in endless identity politics rather than moving toward inclusive growth and shared prosperity.
